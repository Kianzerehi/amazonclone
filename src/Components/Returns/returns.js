        Thank you for checking out my clone of the Amazon website! It was a fun
        website I decided to do to test my skills in building an e-commerce
        site. My goal was to create a basic functioning application that would
        allow a user to create an account, add items to the cart, and search for
        items available. The website was a ton of fun to build but came with its
        own bugs much like any other project. If you have not already, please
        continue using the funcitonality on the website. Thank you so much for
        playing around here!
